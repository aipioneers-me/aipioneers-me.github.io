# User account management
The 'Apply as participant' buttom goes to a google form
Once manually approaved they get an email with login information 
We want to use Auth0 to handle registed users
(There is a 'login' handled by Auth0, but no 'register' - this works only via the google form)

# Reserach Projects page
If users are not logged in:
-It shows on the top: 'You have to fill out the general registration first before you can apply to individual projects.'
-There is no 'Apply to this Project' buttom. 
If the user is logged in:
-Clicking 'Apply to this Project' shows a bigger box with: the pdf project description, 'In order to apply to this project submit a pdf with your answers to these questions:', the three student questions define by the mentor, an upload buttom.
