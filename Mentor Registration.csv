Timestamp,Email,Name,Organization,Please write a short bio about yourself (in third person). It will be visible to students when they browse project opportunities.,"Upload your research project here (1 pages). Mention the purpose of the research, the research gap you aim to address, and the methods you aim to explore. Include references to related work. ",Enter a title for your research project.,"What is the research area of the proposed project? (If multiple, separate with commas.)","Which competencies/experience/classes should students bring to work on your project (we are mainly focusing on undergraduate students)? These prerequisites will be displayed to students, and they will be asked to explain how they meet them.
Examples:
·      Highly proficient using Python. 
·      Trained or fine-tuned a transformer language model in PyTorch (toy models and following guides is fine).
·      At least 50 hours working with LLMs.","Specify three questions for students to answer, ideally specific to your project.
Example Questions:
·      Please provide a critique of the following paper: [link to paper]
·      Propose an initial experiment to begin researching the questions in the research plan. 
·      Please link to a public code repository or Colab notebook that shows something you’ve implemented. A small or toy project is perfectly fine.

Student Question 1:",Student Question 2:,Student Question 3:,What are the minimum hours per week you would like students to spend on your project? Note that most students will work part-time on projects.,Please upload a photo of yourself

His past research focused on computational biology and autonomous learning systems with life science applications. He served as director of the AI extension school at ICLS and runs research project in collaboration with Yale and ETH Zurich. As a dedicated educator, he has been teaching over 500 students in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and artificial intelligence since 2019.
Before this he pioneered data science in Switzerland and he founded a platform for open education to foster collaboration between academics and professional data scientists. After his Ph.D. he worked at Stanford University and  CERN where he contributed to searches for supersymmetric particles, microscopic black holes, and the Higgs boson, whose discovery was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2013. In his Ph.D. thesis, he pioneered machine learning in particle physics and developed one of the first applications of machine learning at the petabyte scale.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jmIBTYQj0uvBxRkcD1TJME0bk9NhZLxg,Robust Scoring of Research Ideas,AI for Scientific Discovery,Highly proficient using Python.
